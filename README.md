## About Me

I have lived in London all my life, and although I love to travel and have done so far and wide, I have no intention to move overseas as I love London too much. Although I had studied programming at A-Level, I found the course much too academic for my tastes and left to study psychology instead. Hopefully the courses offered by CodeYourFuture will change my view and will cause me to become enthusiastic about programing again.

This project represents my first attempt at a complete construction of a website after undertaking an introductory CYF course. Although I had dabbled in HTML programming before when designing some primitive websites, this is my first taste of CSS and am looking forward to learning more. My one regret is that I didn't get as much time as I would have liked to properly understand the syntax and then rigorousness involved.

My other hobbies include photography and I regularly attend themed group photoshoots.
